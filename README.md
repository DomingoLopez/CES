# Cultural Ecosystem Services
The connection between nature and human well-being is well-recognized, with studies highlighting its cultural, emotional, and recreational benefits. However, identifying how these benefits manifest and understanding users of natural spaces remains a challenge. Social media image datasets provide valuable insights into this interaction, despite their diverse and complex content.

Advances in AI, particularly Vision Transformers and multimodal models like LLaVA, enable efficient analysis of large, unlabeled datasets. Tools such as DinoV2 and HDBSCAN clustering algorithms help classify and group images, combining geometric and semantic insights.

This projects develops a framework using Deep Learning to analyze social media images, clustering and auto-labeling them to study human-nature interactions. Findings show that noise-aware clustering with advanced models achieves effective categorization. The project advances understanding of nature’s benefits and demonstrates AI’s potential for managing and preserving natural environments.
